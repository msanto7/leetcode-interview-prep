# Two Pointer

    - uses pointers to an array, string or list
    - used to eliminated nested looping structures and improve time complexity  

    Types
        - starting on opposite ends of the list
        - moving in the same direction 
            - fast-slow
            - sliding window
        - merging sorted arrays
        


## When to use
    --> Searching for pairs in a sorted array (e.g., Two Sum in a sorted array).
    --> Finding subarrays or subsequences (e.g., Longest substring problems).
    --> Rearranging or modifying an array in place (e.g., Remove Duplicates).
    --> Solving geometric problems on arrays (e.g., Trapping Rain Water, Container With Most Water
