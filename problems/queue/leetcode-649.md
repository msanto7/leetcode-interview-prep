# LeetCode -- 649. Dota2 Senate (Medium)

    - round based procedure
    - each round a senator can either 
        - ban 1 senators right (for this and all following rounds)
        - announce the victory
    - length of string is the num of senators
    - the output is the string of either of the 2 parties
    - this wasn't as explicitly said...but it sounds like the length of the string is also the number of rounds based on the examples
    - just kidding it sounds like it goes until a decision can be made so no set amount of rounds

    - so we are obviously supposed to use a queue to solve this somehow...lets think about some ways this might work
