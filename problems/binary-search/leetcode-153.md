# Leetcode - 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium)

    - alright so we get a rotated sorted array
    - we are returning the minimum element -- the value not the index
    - specifically asks for an o(log(n)) algorithm so already sort of thinking binary search
    - because otherwise we could just can the array and return te first element that is less than the previous i guess
    - but worst case on that is O(n)
    - 

# Primitive Solution - (Time: O(log(n)), Space: O(n))
