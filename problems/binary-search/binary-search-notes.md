# Binary Search Tree (BST)

    - searching algorithm that splits sorted data on a pivot
    - cuts search area in half each time
    - recursive and iterative implementations

# C#

    - 


## When to use

    - when you need a searching algorithm better than constant time
    - best case O(1) -- worst case O(log(n))
    - sorted data
    - if you have access to elements by index (arrays  NOT linked lists)
    - better if the data is not often changing
