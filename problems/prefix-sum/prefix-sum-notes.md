# Prefix Sum

    - so the general idea here is to build a separate array with the sum of all elements up to the index
    - O(n) is used for processing the prefix sum array



## When to use

    - Efficient Range Sum Queries (e.g., "Find the sum of elements in range [L, R]")
    - Difference Array Technique (for range updates in O(1), e.g., adding x to all elements in a range)
    - Subarray Problems (e.g., "Find the number of subarrays with a given sum")
    - Binary Search Optimization (e.g., searching for a subarray that meets a condition in O(log N) instead of O(N))
    - Finding Equilibrium Index (e.g., "Find index where the sum of left and right parts are equal")
