# LeetCode -- 443. String Compression (Medium)

    - so right off the bat I have to atleast traverse the array 1 time
    - I need some sense of what the previous character is...and a count associated to that character
    - they are asking for constant extra space so we should be modifying the input array in place
    - so I have a relatively close solution...but I am just having trouble handling the last character situation
    - because we have to look back essentially to see what is next



# Primitive Solution - (Time: O(n), Space: O(n))


# Optimized Solution - (Time: O(n), Space: O(1))
