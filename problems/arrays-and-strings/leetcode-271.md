# LeetCode -- 271. Encode and Decode Strings (Medium)

    - we are given a list of strings - and need to encode to a string
    - and then we decode it back to the original list
    - so my first thought is to use some type of strange character as our separator to tell whether we have a new string
    - but the string can contain any ascii characters 
    
    - so I get the idea of using something outside of the ascii character range as a delimeter...that is pretty easy and obvious
    -
