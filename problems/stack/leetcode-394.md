# LeetCode -- 394. Decode String (Medium)

    - alright so the premise is that we need to decode this string...repeating what is inside brackets k times
    - k[string]

    - so need a stack to push and process the open and closing brackets
    - so the problem states that we do not have to deal with malformed strings
    -
