# Sliding Window

    - used as a way to optimize string and array problems
    - a sub section of two-pointer solutions

    Types
        - fixed-size window
        - variable-size window

    - typically will end up being an O(n) time and space solution (although will be more than n operations in some cases)


## When to use

    - for subarray and subsequence problems
    - finding max or min operations in an array
    - when you have nested for loops O(n^2) and the solution would likely timeout
