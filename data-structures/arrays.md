## Arrays 
    - collection of similar items stored in contiguous memory
    - an apartment in an apartment complex
    - mapping of values to indices

    static -- allocates memory at compile time and is a fixed size
    vs.
    dynamic -- automatically grows on insert when there is no space left

    C#
        - in C# all arrays are dynamically allocated
        - can be primitive types or objects
        - however the objects aren't stored in the contiguous memory...they are stored in the heap

        - 3 types
            - 1-D
            - multi-D (rectangular)
            - jagged

# Big(O) 
    - constant time access to elements via indexing (O(1))
    - insertion O(n)
    - deletion O(n)
    - update O(1)
